# Darwin Maze Dungeon
Python text-based game.
This game is currently under development.

I called it "Darwin Maze Dungeon" because I'm coding in MacOs (Darwin), but it should work in MacOs and Linux.

### Currently working
The movement of a character icon through the maze.

### Problems
1. To run this game, it should run in root, because of the keyboard module.
2. At this moment, this game is incompatible with Windows, because I'm using emojis to represent the graphic elements in the terminal, but emojis aren't compatible with Windows CMD.
