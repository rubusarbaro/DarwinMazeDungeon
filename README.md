# Darwin Maze Dungeon
Python text based game.
This game is currently under development.

I called it "Darwin Maze Dungeon" because I'm coding in MacOs (Darwin), but it should work in MacOs, Linux and Windows.

### Currently working
The movement of a character icon through the maze.

### Problems
1. To run this game, it should run in root, because of the keyboard module.
